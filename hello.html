BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister.

BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave.

BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations. CUT TO: SEQ. 95 - GRADUATION EXT.

The numbers on the podium change to 9:15. BUZZWELL (CONT’D) ...9:15. (he clears his throat) And that concludes our graduation ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries. BARRY Are we going to pick our job today? ADAM I heard it’s just orientation. The rows of chairs change in transformer-like mechanical motion to Universal Studios type tour trams. Buzzwell walks off stage. BARRY (re: trams) Whoa, heads up! Here we go. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 6. SEQ. 125 - “FACTORY” FEMALE VOICE (V.O) Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (in Spanish) Dejen las manos y antennas adentro del tram a todos tiempos. BARRY I wonder what it’s going to be like? ADAM A little scary. Barry shakes Adam. BARRY AND ADAM AAHHHH! The tram passes under SIGNS READING: “Honex: A Division of Honesco: A Part of the Hexagon Group.” TRUDY Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco, and a part of the Hexagon group. BARRY This is it! The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONT’D) Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this... Trudy GRABS a TEST TUBE OF HONEY from a technician. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 7. TRUDY (CONT’D) ...soothing, sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow, you all know as... EVERYONE ON THE TRAM (in unison) H-o-n-e-y. Trudy flips the flask into the crowd, and laughs as they all scramble for it. ANGLE ON: A GIRL BEE catching the honey. ADAM (sotto) That girl was hot. BARRY (sotto) She’s my cousin. ADAM She is? BARRY Yes, we’re all cousins. ADAM Right. You’re right. TRUDY At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. ANGLE ON: A STUNT BEE in a HELMET getting hit with a NEWSPAPER, then a SHOE, then a FLYSWATTER. He gets up, and gives a “thumb’s up”. The graduate bees APPLAUD. ADAM (re: stunt bee) What do you think he makes? BARRY Not enough. TRUDY And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 8. BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam’s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it’s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you’ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry’s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn’t know that. ADAM What’s the difference? TRUDY And you’ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven’t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you’ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We’ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes into a snapshot. Barry looks concerned. The tram continues through 2 doors. FORM DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - “WALKING THE HIVE” INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON: The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY (annoyed) “What’s the difference?” Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That’s an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, I’m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? We’re bees. We’re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: “Bee Goes Berserk: Stings Seven Then Self.” ANGLE ON: A BEE filling his car’s gas tank from a honey pump. He fills his car some, then takes a swig for himself. NEWSPAPER BEE (to the bee guzzling gas) Hey! Barry and Adam begin to cross the street. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 10. BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I don’t know. But you know what I’m talking about. They walk off. SEQ. 400 - “MEET THE JOCKS” SFX: The SOUND of Pollen Jocks. PAN DOWN from the Honex statue.

FOUR PATROL BEES FLY in through the hive’s giant Gothic entrance. The Patrol Bees are wearing fighter pilot helmets with black visors. ADAM (CONT’D) I’ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it’s like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don’t come back. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You’re monsters. You’re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don’t know. BARRY Their day’s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can’t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT’D) Look at that. That’s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It’s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you’re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren’t they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let’s have some fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat, and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1 Oh my. BARRY I never thought I’d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn’t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ You know, we’re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It’s a puddle-jump for us. But maybe you’re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering louder) You are not! BUZZ We’re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re: j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred means.

BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring. (making the stirring motion) You grab that stick and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm, it’s a beautiful thing. BARRY You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn’t right for me. MARTIN BENSON And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That’s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 15. BARRY Well no... MARTIN BENSON Janet, your son’s not sure he wants to go into honey. JANET BENSON Oh Barry, you are so funny sometimes. BARRY I’m not trying to be funny. MARTIN BENSON You’re not funny, you’re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer. JANET BENSON You’re going to be a stirrer?! BARRY No one’s listening to me. MARTIN BENSON Wait until you see the sticks I have for you. BARRY I can say anything I want right now. I’m going to get an ant tattoo. JANET BENSON Let’s open some fresh honey and celebrate. BARRY Maybe I’ll pierce my thorax! MARTIN BENSON (toasting) To honey! BARRY Shave my antennae! JANET BENSON To honey! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 16. BARRY Shack up with a grasshopper, get a gold tooth, and start calling everybody “Dawg.” CUT TO: SEQ. 760 - “JOB PLACEMENT” EXT. HONEX LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ANGLE ON: A BEE BUS STOP. One group of bees stands on the pavement, as another group hovers above them. A doubledecker bus pulls up.

THE COLUMNS READ: “OCCUPATION” “POSITIONS AVAILABLE”, and “STATUS”. The middle column has numbers, and the right column has job openings flipping between “open”, “pending”, and “closed”. BUZZWELL (CONT’D) Oh, I’m sorry. The Krelman just closed out. ADAM Oh! He takes the hat off Adam. BUZZWELL Wax Monkey’s always open. The Krelman goes from “Closed” to “Open”.

Bring it around thirty degrees and hold. BARRY (sotto) Roses. JACKSON Thirty degrees, roger, bringing it around. Many pollen jocks break off from the main group. They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, it’s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? It’s a little bit of magic, ain’t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. That’s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that’s pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool. The Jock WINKS at Barry. Barry rejoins the other jocks in the sky. They swoop in over a pond, kissing the surface. We see their image reflected in the water; they’re really moving. They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I’m picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don’t we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual. We see what appear to be yellow flowers on a green field. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 24. They go into a deep bank and dive. BUZZ Hold on, one of these flowers seems to be on the move. SPLITZ Say again...Are you reporting a moving flower? BUZZ Affirmative. SEQ. 900 - “TENNIS GAME” The pollen jocks land. It is a tennis court with dozens of tennis balls. A COUPLE, VANESSA and KEN, plays tennis. The bees land right in the midst of a group of balls. KEN (O.C) That was on the line! The other bees start walking around amongst the immense, yellow globes. SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don’t know, but I’m loving this color. SPLITZ (smelling tennis ball) Smells good. Not like a flower. But I like it. JACKSON Yeah, fuzzy. BUZZ Chemical-y. JACKSON Careful, guys, it’s a little grabby. Barry LANDS on a ball and COLLAPSES. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 25. BARRY Oh my sweet lord of bees. JACKSON Hey, candy brain, get off there! Barry attempts to pulls his legs off, but they stick. BARRY Problem! A tennis shoe and a hand ENTER FRAME. The hand picks up the ball with Barry underneath it. BARRY (CONT'D) Guys! BUZZ This could be bad. JACKSON Affirmative. Vanessa walks back to the service line, BOUNCES the ball. Each time it BOUNCES, the other bees cringe and GASP. ANGLE ON: Barry, terrified. Pure dumb luck, he’s not getting squished. BARRY (with each bounce) Very close...Gonna Hurt...Mamma’s little boy. SPLITZ You are way out of position, rookie. ANGLE ON: Vanessa serving. We see Barry and the ball up against the racket as she brings it back. She tosses the ball into the air; Barry’s eyes widen. The ball is STRUCK, and the rally is on. KEN Coming in at you like a missile! Ken HITS the ball back. Barry feels the g-forces. ANGLE ON: The Pollen Jocks watching Barry pass by them in SLOW MOTION. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 26. BARRY (in slow motion) Help me! JACKSON You know, I don't think these are flowers. SPLITZ Should we tell him? JACKSON I think he knows. BARRY (O.S) What is this?! Vanessa HITS a high arcing lob. Ken waits, poised for the return. We see Barry having trouble maneuvering the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running up. He has a killer look in his eyes. He’s going to hit the ultimate overhead smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe you’re about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the jock. KEN What? No! He misses badly. The ball rockets into oblivion. Barry is still hanging on. ANGLE ON: Ken, berating himself.

SON He’s back here! He’s going to sting me! The car SWERVES around the road. Barry flies into the back, where the slobbery dog SNAPS at him. Barry deftly avoids the jaws and gross, flying SPITTLE. MOTHER Nobody move. If you don’t move, he won’t sting you. Freeze! Everyone in the car freezes. Barry freezes. They stare at each other, eyes going back and forth, waiting to see who will make the first move. Barry blinks. GRANNY He blinked! Granny pulls out a can of HAIR SPRAY. SON Spray him, Granny! Granny sprays the hair spray everywhere. FATHER What are you doing? GRANNY It’s hair spray! Extra hold! MOTHER Kill it! Barry gets sprayed back by the hair spray, then sucked out of the sunroof. CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 29. EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS BARRY Wow. The tension level out here is unbelievable. I’ve got to get home.

BARRY (CONT'D) (out of breath) Drapes! (then, re: glass) That is diabolical. KEN It’s fantastic. It’s got all my special skills, even my top ten favorite movies. ANDY What’s your number one? Star Wars? KEN Ah, I don’t go for that, (makes Star Wars noises), kind of stuff. ANGLE ON: Barry. BARRY No wonder we’re not supposed to talk to them. They’re out of their minds.

That would really hurt. BARRY No. MARTIN BENSON Up the nose? That’s a killer. BARRY No. There’s only one place you can sting the humans. One place where it really matters.

I mean, what about Bee-Columbus? Bee-Ghandi? Be-geesus? BEE LARRY KING Well, where I’m from you wouldn’t think of suing humans. We were thinking more like stick ball, candy stores. BARRY How old are you? BEE LARRY KING I want you to know that the entire bee community is supporting you in this case, which is certain to be the trial of the bee century. BARRY Thank you, Larry.

MONTGOMERY (grumbles, clears his throat) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silk worm for the elastic in my britches. Talking bee. How do we know this isn’t some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams, robotics, ventriloquism, cloning...for all we know he could be on steroids! Montgomery leers at Barry, who moves to the stand. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 73. JUDGE Mr. Benson? Barry makes his opening statement. BARRY Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there’s no trickery here. I’m just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey’s pretty important to me. It’s important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us cause we’re the little guys. And what I’m hoping is that after this is all over, you’ll see how by taking our honey, you’re not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are. ANGLE ON: Vanessa smiling.

I find that to be a very disturbing term, I have to say. I don’t imagine you employ any bee free-ers, do you? MR. VANDERHAYDEN No. BARRY I’m sorry. I couldn’t hear you. MR. VANDERHAYDEN (louder) No. BARRY No. Because you don’t free bees. You keep bees. And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey? MR. VANDERHAYDEN Well, they’re very lovable creatures. Yogi-bear, Fozzy-bear, Build-a-bear. BARRY Yeah, you mean like this?! Vanessa and the SUPERINTENDANT from her building ENTER with a GIANT FEROCIOUS GRIZZLY BEAR. He has a neck collar and chains extending from either side. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 75.

Ken and Barry look at each other as Barry eats. BARRY So, I hear you’re quite a tennis player. I’m not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. KEN That’s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that “eating with chopsticks” isn’t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think I don’t see what you’re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN That’s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table.

"Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 81. KEN It’s funny, I just can’t seem to recall that! Ken WHACKS at Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT'D) I think something stinks in here. He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower, pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY Ken, look at me! I’m wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic.

KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You’re bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he’s surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf’s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly.

What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We’re friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry’s face) How good? BARRY What?

Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don’t! It’s what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I’m hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can’t treat them like equals. They’re strip-ed savages! Stinging’s the only thing they know! It’s their way!

The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn’t I? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn’t matter. The important thing is you’re alive. You could have died. ADAM I’d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT’D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there’s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can’t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I’m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we’re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don’t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn’t sound so bad. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don’t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my.

ADAM The smoke. Bees don’t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don’t smoke. Bees don’t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that’s it! That’s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is?

ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who’s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil’s boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it’s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don’t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven’t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court’s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He’s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery’s motion. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can’t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge’s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It’s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn’t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or Non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge’s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting "Free the bees". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a “high 5”. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5’s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I’m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won’t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You’ll regret this.

DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - “HONEY ROUNDUP” EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we’re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we’re all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments. MONTAGE IMAGES: Close-up on an ATF JACKET, with the YELLOW LETTERS. Camera pulls back. We see an ARMY OF BEE AND HUMAN AGENTS wearing hastily made “Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Honey” jackets.

The bees look around, bewildered. WORKER BEE 5 What do we do now? A BEAT. WORKER BEE 6 Cannon ball!! He jumps into a HONEY VAT, doesn’t penetrate the surface. He looks around, and slowly sinks down to his waist. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 98. EXT. HONEX FACTORY THE WHISTLE BLOWS, and the bees all stream out the exit. CUT TO: INT.

TRACKING SHOT into the hive, through the lobby of Honex, and into Adam’s office. CUT TO: INT. ADAM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Barry meets Adam in his office. Adam’s office is in disarray. There are papers everywhere. He’s filling up his cardboard hexagon box. BARRY (out of breath) Adam, you wouldn’t believe how much honey was out there. ADAM Oh yeah? BARRY What’s going on around here? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 100. ADAM (exiting with a cardboard box of belongings) No, they’re just home. They don’t know what to do. BARRY Hmmm. ADAM They’re laying out, they’re sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. BARRY At least we got our honey back. They walk through the empty factory. ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn’t? It’s the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. ANGLE ON: Adam’s desk on it’s side in the hall. ADAM (CONT’D) This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...and now I can’t. Adam EXITS. CUT TO: SEQ. 3900 - “WORLD WITHOUT BEES” INT. STAIRWELL Vanessa and Barry are walking up the stairs to the roof. BARRY I don’t understand why they’re not happy. We have so much now. I thought their lives would be better. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 101. VANESSA Hmmm. BARRY They’re doing nothing. It’s amazing, honey really changes people. VANESSA You don’t have any idea what’s going on, do you? BARRY What did you want to show me? VANESSA This. They reach the top of the stairs. Vanessa opens the door. CUT TO: EXT. VANESSA’S ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS Barry sees Vanessa’s flower pots and small garden have all turned brown. BARRY What happened here? VANESSA That is not the half of it... Vanessa turns Barry around with her two fingers, revealing the view of Central Park, which is also all brown. BARRY Oh no. Oh my. They’re all wilting. VANESSA Doesn’t look very good, does it? BARRY No. VANESSA And who’s fault do you think that is? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 102. BARRY Mmmm...you know, I’m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn’t think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it’s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that’s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there’s no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn’t it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact? VANESSA (not sure if he’s joking) How would we do it? BARRY I’ll sting you, you step on me. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 103. VANESSA That just kills you twice. BARRY Right, right. VANESSA Listen Barry. Sorry but I’ve got to get going. She EXITS. BARRY (looking out over the park) Had to open my mouth and talk... (looking back) Vanessa..? Vanessa is gone. CUT TO: SEQ. 3935 - “GOING TO PASADENA” EXT. NY STREET - CONTINUOUS Vanessa gets into a cab. Barry ENTERS. BARRY Vanessa. Why are you leaving? Where are you going? VANESSA To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They moved it up to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It’s the last chance I’ll ever have to see it. BARRY Vanessa, I just want to say I’m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. VANESSA I know. Me neither. Vanessa cab drives away. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 104. BARRY (chuckling to himself) Tournament of Roses. Roses can’t do sports. Wait a minute...roses. Roses? Roses!? Vanessa! Barry follows shortly after. He catches up to it, and he pounds on the window. Barry follows shortly after Vanessa’s cab. He catches up to it, and he pounds on the window. INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Barry motions for her to roll the window down. She does so. BARRY Roses?! VANESSA Barry? BARRY (as he flies next to the cab) Roses are flowers. VANESSA Yes, they are. BARRY Flowers, bees, pollen! VANESSA I know. That’s why this is the last parade. BARRY Maybe not. The cab starts pulling ahead of Barry. BARRY (CONT'D) (re: driver) Could you ask him to slow down? VANESSA Could you slow down? The cabs slows. Barry flies in the window, and lands in the change box, which closes on him. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 105. VANESSA (CONT'D) Barry! Vanessa lets him out. Barry stands on the change box, in front of the driver’s license. BARRY Okay, I made a huge mistake! This is a total disaster, and it’s all my fault! VANESSA Yes, it kind of is. BARRY I’ve ruined the planet. And, I wanted to help with your flower shop. Instead, I’ve made it worse. VANESSA Actually, it’s completely closed down. BARRY Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea. And it’s greater than all my previous great ideas combined. VANESSA I don’t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry. BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here’s what I’m thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant, and flower bud in this park. All we’ve got to do is get what they’ve got back here with what we’ve got. VANESSA Bees... BARRY Park... VANESSA Pollen... "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 106. BARRY Flowers... VANESSA Repollination! BARRY (on luggage handle, going up) Across the nation! CUT TO: SEQ. 3950 - “ROSE PARADE” EXT. PASADENA PARADE BARRY (V.O) Alright. Tournament of Roses. Pasadena, California.

PRINCESS The pea? It’s supposed to be under the mattresses. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 108. BARRY Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. PRINCESS I’m going to go talk to the marshall. BARRY You do that. This whole parade is a fiasco! She EXITS. Vanessa removes the step-ladder. The princess FALLS. Barry and Vanessa take off in the float.

FLOAT STAGING AREA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER ANGLE ON: Vanessa putting the princess hat on. BARRY (V.O) Then all we do is blend in with traffic, without arousing suspicion. CUT TO: EXT.

DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 4025 - “COCKPIT FIGHT” INT. AIRPLANE Vanessa is on the aisle. Barry is on a laptop calculating flowers, pollen, number of bees, airspeed, etc. He does a “Stomp” dance on the keyboard. BARRY Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is going to work, Vanessa. VANESSA It’s got to work. PILOT (V.O) Attention passengers. This is Captain Scott. I’m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area. And looks like we’re going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. VANESSA Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They’ll never make it. BARRY I’ve got to get up there and talk to these guys. VANESSA Be careful. Barry flies up to the cockpit door. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS A female flight attendant, ANGELA, is in the cockpit with the pilots. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 111. There’s a KNOCK at the door.

PILOT (pulling an earphone back, to the co-pilot) What did you say, Hal? CO-PILOT I didn’t say anything. PILOT (he sees Barry) Ahhh! Bee! BARRY No, no! Don’t freak out! There’s a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones) Ahhh! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 112. The pilot grabs a “DUSTBUSTER” vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilot’s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I’m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who’s an attorney? PILOT Don’t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot’s nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button. The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold. Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN Vanessa studies her laptop, looking serious. SFX: PA CRACKLE. BARRY (V.O) (in captain voice) Good afternoon passengers, this is your captain speaking. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24F please report to the cockpit. And please hurry! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 113. ANGLE ON: The aisle, and Vanessa head popping up. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA What happened here? BARRY I tried to talk to them, but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded...Now one’s bald, one’s in a boat, and they’re both unconscious. VANESSA Is that another bee joke? BARRY No. No one’s flying the plane. The AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, BUD, speaks over the radio. BUD This is JFK control tower. Flight 356, what’s your status? Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. I’m a florist from New York. BUD Where’s the pilot? VANESSA He’s unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience? A BEAT. BARRY As a matter of fact, there is. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 114. BUD Who’s that? VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It’s got giant wings, huge engines. VANESSA I can’t fly a plane. BARRY Why not? Isn’t John Travolta a pilot? VANESSA Yes? BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we’re headed into some lightning. CUT TO: Vanessa shrugs, and takes the controls. SEQ. 4150 - “BARRY FLIES PLANE” INT.

CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there’s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I’m quite familiar with Mr. Benson’s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven’t they done enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn’t he your only hope right now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn’t be able to fly at all. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are too big-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold on a second. Haven’t we heard this million times? The surface area of the wings, and the body mass doesn’t make sense? JEANETTE CHUNG Get this on the air. CAMERAMAN You got it! CUT TO: INT. BEE TV CONTROL ROOM An engineer throws a switch. BEE ENGINEER Stand by. We’re going live. The “ON AIR” sign illuminates. CUT TO: INT. VARIOUS SHOTS OF NEW HIVE CITY The news report plays on TV. The pollen jocks are sitting around, playing paddle-ball, Wheel-o, and one of them is spinning his helmet on his finger. Buzzwell is in an office cubicle, playing computer solitaire. Barry’s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That’s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That’s the bee way. We’re not made of Jello. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. CROWD OF BEES Hello! CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Barry is giving orders to Vanessa.

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING HITS the plane. The plane takes a sharp dip. VANESSA (CONT’D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time.

VANESSA You don’t have to yell. BARRY I’m not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. VANESSA It’s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. BARRY It’s not a tone.

No high five. VANESSA Right. ADAM Barry, it worked. Did you see the giant flower? BARRY What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius, man. Genius! ADAM Thank you. BARRY But we’re not done yet. Barry flies up to the wing of the plane, and addresses the bee crowd. BARRY (CONT’D) Listen everyone. This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We’re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we’re going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains? BEES We’re bees! KEYCHAIN BEE Keychain! BARRY Then follow me... Except Keychain. BUZZ Hold on Barry. You’ve earned this.

Another one coming down.



 

                   

Hang on.



 

                   

THE MASK



 

                   

I got those...



 

                   

concert tickets you wanted.



 

                   

You're kidding!



 

                   

For Friday night?



 

                   

Stanley, this is great.



 

                   

What time do I pick you up?



  

                   

Here's the thing.



  

                   

My best girlfriend is here

and she'd die to go to this...



  

                   

so could we get an extra ticket

for her?



  

                   

They're sold out. That means

there's no more.



  

                   

I can't let her sit home all alone.



  

                   

I'll tell you what.



  

                   

Go with your friend.



  

                   

I couldn't do that.



  

                   

No, come on.



  

                   

Stanley, you are the nicest guy.



  

                   

Really, you are.



  

                   

- Isn't he the nicest guy?

- The best.



  

                   

That was the most sickening display



  

                   

- I've ever seen.

- I disagree.



  

                   

I'm wearing her down.



  

                   

Buddy, you need a little

change of pace.



  

                   

Tonight, I'll take you

on a love safari.



  

                   

Deep into the darkest heart

of the urban jungle.



  

                   

Tell me more, bwana.



  

                   

The Coco Bongo Club.

Hottest new joint in town.



  

                   

Only the cr me de la cr me

need apply.



  

                   

- How do we get in?

- Are you kidding?



  

                   

Leave it to me.

Trust me, buddy.



  

                   

This will be the perfect...



  

                   

night on the town.



  

                   

Hold the phone.



  

                   

Killer at three o'clock.



  

                   

Stand back and observe.



  

                   

Where do I open an account?



  

                   

New accounts,right here.



  

                   

You're lucky, I was on my way out--



  

                   

Hold this for me, please?



  

                   

I'll hold anything you want.



  

                   

Can you help me?



  

                   

So...



  

                   

what kind of account do you want?



  

                   

Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm

just terrible with things like that.



  

                   

That's an interesting tie, Mister...



  

                   

Ipkiss, Stanley lpkiss.



  

                   

Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.



  

                   

Pleasure's all mine.



  

                   

May l?



  

                   

What?



  

                   

I'm such a mess.



  

                   

Oh, of course.



  

                   

That's what they're there for.



  

                   

As I was saying, that tie...



  

                   

reminds me of those,

what do you call it, ink blot tests.



  

                   

- A Rorschach test.

- Right.



  

                   

It sort of looks like...



  

                   

a young woman riding bareback.



  

                   

Sort of...



  

                   

Lady Godiva or something.



  

                   

Of course.



  

                   

What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?



  

                   

I don't know.



  

                   

Bright colors...



  

                   

It's a power tie.



  

                   

Supposed to make you feel...



  

                   

powerful.



  

                   

Does it work?



  

                   

Now, how about that account?



  

                   

We have...



  

                   

several different plans.



  

                   

Savings.



  

                   

Checking.



  

                   

Savings and checking.



  

                   

Savings and CD's.



  

                   

Checking and CD's.



  

                   

Savings, checking and CD's.

T-Bills.



  

                   

Or we can throw your money

in a big mattress.



  

                   

Now, I have some forms

for you to fill out.



  

                   

That's it, sweetheart.

Now just a little bit to the right.



  

                   

Keep it down back there.



  

                   

We'll try.



  

                   

- What do you think?

- Layout's not bad. But...



  

                   

the motion detectors are a pain.



  

                   

But you can pull this off, right?



  

                   

You talking to the Doctor.



  

                   

I do have one question.



  

                   

Which is?



  

                   

What's Niko have to say about this?



  

                   

Nothing.



  

                   

- This isn't his grift.

- Get real, man.



  

                   

Everything is his grift.



  

                   

He owns you, he owns this club,

he owns this whole stinking town.



  

                   

Things change.



  

                   

You mess with Niko, you end up

taking a dirt nap.



  

                   

He's the only one who's napping...



  

                   

and I'm about to give him

a serious wake-up call.



   

                   

But we need cash...



   

                   

so first we take the bank...



   

                   

then we take Niko...



   

                   

and then, my friend,

school is out.



   

                   

And this whole city is our playground.



   

                   

Bub, watch where you're going!



   

                   

Hang on, hang on!



   

                   

Don't get your panties in a twist.



   

                   

What the hell is it?



   

                   

I don't know...



   

                   

about seven hundred bucks, eh?



   

                   

Now, what can I do for you, bub?



   

                   

I'm here for the Civic.



   

                   

The brake drums are shot

and you need a new transmission.



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

All I wanted was an oil change.



   

                   

Lucky we caught these problems

before they caused serious trouble.



   

                   

Sign right here, and press down hard.



   

                   

- There's no price.

- There will be.



   

                   

I've no car.

I need a car tonight.



   

                   

Bring around the loaner.



   

                   

The loaner?



   

                   

The loaner?



   

                   

It's a classic.



   

                   

Gals, meet my buddy Stanley lpkiss.



   

                   

Humungo in the banking business.



   

                   

- Not really.

- Let's get in this joint.



   

                   

How you doing, buddy?



   

                   

- It's Charlie!

- How you doing?



   

                   

- How you doing, my friend?

- Long time no see.



   

                   

Good to see you.



   

                   

Come on, gals.



   

                   

See you on the inside.



   

                   

This is a mistake.



   

                   

You crossed the rope.

Never cross the rope.



   

                   

- My friends are inside.

- Lose him.



   

                   

This isn't fair.



   

                   

Watch it, I'm a bleeder.



   

                   

Put me down now, or I am

never coming back here.



   

                   

Jeez.



   

                   

Mr. Ipkiss!



   

                   

Hi.



   

                   

Are you okay?



   

                   

Me?



   

                   

I'm great..



   

                   

Really good.



   

                   

I never felt better, really.



   

                   

I'm just...



   

                   

catching some air.



   

                   

Your car, sir.



   

                   

That's not my car.



   

                   

It matches the ticket.



   

                   

Alright...



   

                   

I'll take it.



   

                   

But I am very angry!



   

                   

Believe this?



   

                   

You drive in in a Porsche...



   

                   

Hey, Mister!



   

                   

Hold on!



   

                   

I know CPR!



   

                   

Hey, you!



   

                   

What are you doing down there?



   

                   

I'm just looking for...



   

                   

my mask!



   

                   

I got it.



   

                   

Do you have any idea what time it is?



   

                   

Actually, no.



   

                   

My new carpet!



   

                   

Well ,this is coming right out

of your security deposit.



   

                   

You know...



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Nothing.



   

                   

Well, that's what you are, lpkiss,

a big nothing.



   

                   

Aren't you due at the lab

to get your bolts tightened?



   

                   

I should have said that.



   

                   

Hey, you.



   

                   

Milo!



   

                   

No jumping up allowed.

It's against doggie ordinance.



   

                   

What do you want?



   

                   

You want me to throw that?



   

                   

I'm very tired.



   

                   

I'll throw it one time.



   

                   

I won't throw it with you

attached to it.



   

                   

You ready?



   

                   

Get it.



   

                   

Ipkiss!



   

                   

Turn down those cartoons!



   

                   

Alright, Mrs. Peenman!



   

                   

Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody

wears a mask?



   

                   

That's correct.



   

                   

We all wear masks,

metaphorically speaking.



   

                   

We suppress the id,

our darkest desires...



   

                   

and adopt a more socially

acceptable image.



   

                   

The book is "The Masks We Wear"

by Dr. Arthur Neuman.



   

                   

Thank you for being here.



   

                   

What's the matter with you?



   

                   

What is it?



   

                   

What are you looking for?



   

                   

You like this thing? You like it?

We all wear masks,

metaphorically speaking".



   

                   

Yeah, right.

Look at that!



   

                   

Time to honk your nose and pull

your underwear over your head.



   

                   

Come on!



   

                   

Step right up here, don't be shy!

Move it!



   

                   

For my first trick...



   

                   

I'll do something for you, son.



   

                   

We have a giraffe. There you go, son.

Now get out of here, you bother me.



   

                   

Now...



   

                   

Sorry, wrong pocket.



   

                   

For you...



   

                   

a little body English.



   

                   

A French poodle.



   

                   

The dog was rabid, had to put it down.



   

                   

At last but not least, my favorite.



   

                   

A Tommy gun.



   

                   

This is incredible.



   

                   

With these powers I could be...



   

                   

a superhero.



   

                   

I'd fight crime,

protect the innocent...



   

                   

work for world peace.



   

                   

But first...



   

                   

RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING



   

                   

Hold onto your lug nuts...



   

                   

it's time for an overhaul.



   

                   

It was a dream.



   

                   

It was a dream.



   

                   

I must lay off the cartoons.



   

                   

Lt. Kellaway. You know anything

about the disturbance last night?



   

                   

Disturbance?



   

                   

Some prowler broke in

and attacked Mrs. Peenman.



   

                   

Attacked?



   

                   

You didn't hear anything?



   

                   

She unloaded a couple of rounds

of buckshot   feet from here.



   

                   

Look at the floor.



   

                   

He put that right in my floor,

then he jumped out...



   

                   

the window. Officer,

are you writing notes?



   

                   

This is...



   

                   

impossible.



   

                   

Those pyjamas are impossible.

This happened.



   

                   

See, I have...



   

                   

an inner ear problem.



   

                   

- Sometimes I can't hear anything.

- Is that so?



   

                   

Here's my card. If you recall

anything unusual about last night...



   

                   

anything at all, call me.



   

                   

You bet. Thank you.



   

                   

And good luck...



   

                   

cracking the case.



   

                   

Oh, my God, I'm late!



   

                   

Keys, keys...



   

                   

Where's the keys?



   

                   

Damn.



   

                   

Get the keys.



   

                   

Find them.



   

                   

Get the keys.



   

                   

I am so late.



   

                   

Good boy.



   

                   

Come on, Milo. Give them to me.

Drop it.



   

                   

I want a proctologist standing by.



   

                   

The best one you can find.



   

                   

Can you tell me what happened?



   

                   

- No, you can quote me.

- Looks like some Mob tactic.



   

                   

She broke the case. Come on,

get these rubbernecks out of here.



   

                   

Where were you last night?

We looked all over for you.



   

                   

Did you happen to look outside,

in the gutter?



   

                   

Did you check the paper?



   

                   

Your girlfriend got a great review.



   

                   

Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo



   

                   

You're    minutes late.

That's like stealing.



   

                   

I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never

happen again. I've been a jerk.



   

                   

If you weren't busy oogling

girlie pictures...



   

                   

you might get some work done.



   

                   

Sir. She's a perspective

client of Stanley's.



   

                   

Really?



   

                   

The next time she comes in...



   

                   

send her to my office.



   

                   

You bet.



   

                   

Gee, I wish "my" daddy

owned a bank.



   

                   

Then I could be a rich

little creep too.



   

                   

You think she'll ever come back?



   

                   

Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.



   

                   

Girls like her always look for

the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.



   

                   

You don't know that.



   

                   

She's an artist. She's...



   

                   

- sensitive.

- Forget her.



   

                   

She'll rip out your heart,

put it in a blender and hit "frappe".



   

                   

You don't need her.

You need somebody down to earth.



   

                   

Somebody with some integrity.

Somebody with...



   

                   

red hair...



   

                   

full, pouting lips...



   

                   

a white blouse, green jacket...



   

                   

and a name tag.



   

                   

You really narrowed it down.



   

                   

Too bad she's already taken.



   

                   

Hello there, may I be of assistance?



   

                   

Stanley lpkiss?



   

                   

Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt

from the Tribune.



   

                   

I canceled my subscription because

they kept stealing--



   

                   

No, actually, I want to ask you

a few questions.



   

                   

Really? About what?



   

                   

Ripley Auto Finishing.

You're a customer, aren't you?



   

                   

Me?



   

                   

I don't even have a car.



   

                   

You know, 'cause they pollute.



   

                   

You don't own an '   Civic?



   

                   

Oh, that car, yeah.



   

                   

It's coming back to me.



   

                   

Miss... What was your name?



   

                   

Peggy Brandt.



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

Peggy Brandt?



   

                   

Of "Ask Peggy"?



   

                   

That's right.



   

                   

You printed one of my letters

last year.



   

                   

Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."



   

                   

You're Mister Nice Guy?



   

                   

Do you realize how much mail

we got about that letter?



   

                   

   's of women are looking

for a guy like you.



   

                   

Really?



   

                   

You know how hard it is to find

a decent man in this town?



   

                   

Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.



   

                   

Why are you covering this story?



   

                   

Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.

I'm starving to death.



   

                   

I'm looking to become a real reporter.



   

                   

When you were at Ripley Auto

did you see anything suspicious?



   

                   

Anything?



   

                   

I won't make trouble for you.



   

                   

I just want the truth.



   

                   

God, I wish I knew the truth.

You know, I really do.



   

                   

If you think of anything...



   

                   

this is my number.



   

                   

This is my...



   

                   

you know, personal number.



   

                   

   's of women are looking

for a guy like me?



   

                   

Sure.



   

                   

I'm one of them.



   

                   

    yards.



   

                   

Hello, Dorian.



   

                   

Thanks for dropping by.



   

                   

Next time, call.

Leave the delivery boys at home.



   

                   

The cops...



   

                   

tried to shut the club

down this morning.



   

                   

They say you've been using the place

to run your own small-time scams.



   

                   

When I hear things like that...



   

                   

I start losing my concentration.



   

                   

My game...



   

                   

it goes straight to hell.



   

                   

You could too.



   

                   

    yards.



   

                   

I'm fed up with you...



   

                   

but....



   

                   

I'll cut you a break.



   

                   

One week to get out of town.



   

                   

After that...



   

                   

I'll use your empty little skull

to break in my new nine iron.



   

                   

Are you okay?



   

                   

Your car, sir.



   

                   

I am now.



   

                   

Tina, come on.



   

                   

You can't.



   

                   

You can't.



   

                   

Go on.



   

                   

I don't believe it.



   

                   

Stupid.



   

                   

She would never...



   

                   

No way!



   

                   

Hold on, Sugar.



   

                   

Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.



   

                   

Somebody,stop me.



   

                   

Can't make the scene

if you don't have the green.



   

                   

I better make a little stop.



   

                   

EDGE CITY POWER

How's it going, Freeze?



   

                   

It's looking good here.



   

                   

You're on your own. I must

go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.



   

                   

Do it.



   

                   

The doctor is about to operate.



   

                   

Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.



   

                   

Cops!



   

                   

Not on the list, not in the club.



   

                   

How do?



   

                   

You on the list?



   

                   

No, but I believe my friends are.

Perhaps you know them?



   

                   

Franklin, Grant...



   

                   

and Jackson.



   

                   

That's it! No one gets in.



   

                   

Now we present the most beautiful

flower of the Congo Bongo...



   

                   

Miss Tina Carlyle.



   

                   

Beautiful.



   

                   

Love makes me treat you...



   

                   

The way that I do

Gee, baby...



   

                   

ain't I good to you



   

                   

There's nothing too good...



   

                   

for a boy that's so true



   

                   

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you



   

                   

I bought you a fur coat

for Christmas



   

                   

A diamond ring...



   

                   

a Cadillac car...



   

                   

And everything



   

                   

Love makes me treat you...



   

                   

the way that I do



   

                   

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you



   

                   

Love makes me treat you...



   

                   

the way that I do



   

                   

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you



   

                   

There's nothing too good...



   

                   

for a man so true



   

                   

Gee,baby, ain't I good to you



   

                   

I know how to make a man happy

I'll treat you right



   

                   

- Why are you here?

- There's trouble.



   

                   

You better come upstairs.



   

                   

Come on, let's go.



   

                   

They got me paying taxes...



   

                   

for what I gave to you



   

                   

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you



   

                   

Let's rock this joint.



   

                   

Smoking.



   

                   

What happened?



   

                   

Someone hit the joint before us.



   

                   

Get that, Doc.



   

                   

Suck on that.



   

                   

Son of a bitch!



   

                   

Who did this, man?



   

                   

Who?!



   

                   

Him!



   

                   

That's the guy.



   

                   

The guy dancing with Tina?



   

                   

He's dead meat.



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

I want this place cleared now.



   

                   

Club's closed. Move it!

You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!



   

                   

Party's over, let's go!



   

                   

Get out of here.



   

                   

Get lost!



   

                   

Okay, Twinkle Toes.



   

                   

Where is my money, tell me now.



   

                   

You've got   .  %  in T-bills

amortized over the fiscal year.



   

                   

  %  in stocks and bonds.



   

                   

Carry the   divide by the GNP...



   

                   

Fortunately, funeral bouquets

Ice this deadbeat.



   

                   

Shoot him!



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

You got me, partner.



   

                   

Hold me close,Red.



   

                   

It's getting dark.



   

                   

Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.



   

                   

Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home

this Christmas.



   

                   

Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.



   

                   

Pardon me.



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

You love me.



   

                   

You really love me.



   

                   

You're not going anywhere.



   

                   

Drop it, Tyrel!



   

                   

Drop it.



   

                   

You got a warrant?

Or did you come for a nightcap?



   

                   

What I got is probable cause.



   

                   

Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.



   

                   

Easy. You're giving me a woody.



   

                   

And one was wearing a big,

green mask.



   

                   

For once, you're right.



   

                   

Except it wasn't one of my boys.



   

                   

Maybe if you tried a little

actual police work...



   

                   

Cuff him.



   

                   

We got a stiff upstairs.

It's a guy from the heist.



   

                   

Call that high-priced

lawyer of yours.



   

                   

We'll go downtown for a chat.



   

                   

Get him out of here.



   

                   

I know you're in there.



   

                   

Police!



   

                   

Open up!



   

                   

Oh, my God.



   

                   

I know you're in there!



   

                   

Open up!



   

                   

Come on, I'm getting blisters

on my fingers.



   

                   

Stop it.



   

                   

I'm coming, okay.



   

                   

I'll be right there.



   

                   

Let's go, move it!



   

                   

Alright!



   

                   

Hi, Lieutenant.



   

                   

This isn't the best time right now.

I just--



   

                   

Won't you come in?



   

                   

Where were you last night?



   

                   

Here, mostly.



   

                   

Something wrong?



   

                   

What do you know about The Mask?



   

                   

"Mask?"



   

                   

Don't insult my intelligence.



   

                   

He robs the bank you work in,

then I find this in the Coco Bongo.



   

                   

There can't be   idiots

with these pajamas.



   

                   

May I see those pajamas?



   

                   

Those pajamas?



   

                   

Those pajamas...



   

                   

were stolen.



   

                   

Somebody stole your pajamas?



   

                   

What is this city coming to...



   

                   

when a man's pajama drawer is

no longer safe!



   

                   

Look at that guy.



   

                   

- Nobody's that fast at my bank.

- I'll say.



   

                   

That's one hell of a rubber mask.



   

                   

Lab reports?



   

                   

We got fingerprints from currency,

but nothing matches Tyrel's men.



   

                   

He beat them to the punch.



   

                   

Get the bank employee files and run

down the prints on a guy named lpkiss.



   

                   

You figure it was an inside job?



   

                   

I need some prints to lock

this whack job up till doomsday.



   

                   

   grand...



   

                   

to whoever finds that green bastard

before the cops.



   

                   

I want you to get the word out

to every street hustler...



   

                   

every low life in this town.

Understand?



   

                   

I want him here tomorrow, alive.



   

                   

You still here?



   

                   

Come on, let's go.



   

                   

What are you looking at?



   

                   

You.



   

                   

You're losing it.



   

                   

I'm not losing anything...



   

                   

except maybe some extra baggage.



   

                   

What's that mean?



   

                   

You didn't fight much last night

when that freak kissed you.



   

                   

Did it look like I had much

of a choice?



   

                   

Maybe you did...



   

                   

maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?



   

                   

I'll tell you one thing.



   

                   

It's going to be payback for anybody

who crosses me.



   

                   

We have a crisis here and you

stroll in an hour late?



   

                   

If I must put up with--



   

                   

Back off, monkey boy...



   

                   

or I'll tell your dad you treat

this place like your piggy bank.



   

                   

Or we should call the IRS...



   

                   

and arrange a vacation for you

at Club Fed?



   

                   

That'll be all.



   

                   

Genius.



   

                   

That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.



   

                   

God! What side of whose bed

did you wake up on, man?



   

                   

I'm not sure.



   

                   

I haven't exactly been myself lately.



   

                   

You don't look real fabulous.



   

                   

Really, do I look bad?



   

                   

Don't worry. This'll put the color

back in your cheeks.



 

                   

Really, do I look bad?



 

                   

Don't worry. This'll put the color

back in your cheeks.



 

                   

  tickets to the charity ball

at the Coco Bongo Club, Saturday.



 

                   

Anybody who's anybody will be there.



 

                   

Want to be my date?



 

                   

Wait just a minute.



 

                   

- Why are you here?

- I wanted to thank you.



 

                   

I don't have much to open an account

with anymore.



 

                   

What about the club?

You were doing great.



  

                   

It's not your problem.

I'll be okay.



  

                   

Come here.



  

                   

You didn't stop by just to see me,

did you?



  

                   

It's okay, tell me.



  

                   

The guy they say robbed this place...



  

                   

- The Mask?

- I think he was at the club.



  

                   

Really?



  

                   

They say he's pretty...



  

                   

weird looking.



  

                   

Yeah, but...



  

                   

you should see him dance.



  

                   

Did anyone find out who he is?



  

                   

Why, you interested?



  

                   

Just curious, I guess.



  

                   

I better be going.



  

                   

Thanks for everything.



  

                   

You'd like to see him again?



  

                   

I wouldn't mind.



  

                   

I know him, you know.



  

                   

You do?



  

                   

We're old college buddies,

him and me.



  

                   

It's funny you mention

he dances because...



  

                   

I taught him a couple of

dance moves myself.



  

                   

Think you could have him

meet me tonight?



  

                   

Maybe I could work something out.



  

                   

- How about at Landfill Park?

- Sunset.



  

                   

- Perfect.

- Super.



  

                   

Thanks, Stanley.

You really are a nice guy.



  

                   

This is an interesting place.



  

                   

Looks like fourth-

or fifth-century Scandinavian.



  

                   

Possibly a representation of one

of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.



  

                   

Loki?



  

                   

Who is Loki?



  

                   

The Norse god of mischief.



  

                   

Supposedly he caused such trouble that

Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.



  

                   

Then he could have banished him

into that mask.



  

                   

I'm talking about mythology,

Mr. Ipkiss.



  

                   

This is a piece of wood.



  

                   

but your book...!



  

                   

My book is about

masks as a metaphor.



  

                   

A metaphor,not to be taken literally.



  

                   

You suffer from a mild delusion.



  

                   

Alright.



  

                   

I'll prove it to you.



  

                   

But I am not responsible

for the consequences.



  

                   

Just sit back and enjoy the ride,

Mr. Expert.



  

                   

You don't scare me.

Go right ahead.



  

                   

See you.



  

                   

You said Loki was a night god.

Maybe it works at night.



  

                   

I should warn you that I don't work

personally with really sick people.



  

                   

There are private institutions

for those things.



  

                   

I can arrange for a safe environment

for you tonight, if you want.



  

                   

I must see Tina.



  

                   

But what can I do?



  

                   

Do I go as myself...



  

                   

or The Mask?



  

                   

If I tell you, you promise

to leave my office right now?



  

                   

Go as yourself...



  

                   

and as The Mask.



  

                   

Because they are both

one and the same beautiful person.



  

                   

Got the cross-check on

the fingerprints. It's lpkiss.



  

                   

I'm looking at him.



  

                   

Keep the SWAT team standing by.



  

                   

If he's half as bad as they say,

we'll have a full dance card.



  

                   

Pickle relish?



  

                   

- Get in the car.

- But I ordered onion rings.



  

                   

LANDFILL PARK



  

                   

What are you doing here?



  

                   

I wanted to make sure that you

  got together all right.



  

                   

That's nice.



  

                   

I hardly ever stop by here.



  

                   

It's hard to believe it was...



  

                   

a garbage heap.



  

                   

It's really beautiful

right around sunset.



  

                   

The methane emissions

really pick up the colors.



  

                   

All those...



  

                   

pinks and greens.



  

                   

My friend will be along here

any minute. I better go.



  

                   

Stanley, wait.



  

                   

Hello, cherie.



  

                   

We meet again!



  

                   

Is it fate?



  

                   

Is it meant to be?

It is written in the stars...



  

                   

that we are destined to fraternize?



  

                   

I'd like to think so.



  

                   

Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal

my croissant.



  

                   

I will spread your p t . I will dip

my ladle in your vichyssoise.



  

                   

She's so coy.



  

                   

I love it.



  

                   

Our love is like a red, red rose.



   

                   

And I am a little thorny.



   

                   

Je t'adore! Je t'adore!



   

                   

Shoot the window. I don't care!



   

                   

This is Kellaway.

I need back-up.



   

                   

Cigarette?



   

                   

Now, like Napoleon...



   

                   

I will divide and conquer.



   

                   

Police!



   

                   

Merde.



   

                   

Freeze.



   

                   

Put your hands up.



   

                   

But you told me to freeze.



   

                   

Alright, alright, unfreeze.



   

                   

You're under arrest.



   

                   

It wasn't me.



   

                   

It was the one-armed man.



   

                   

Alright, I confess.



   

                   

I did it, you hear?

And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!



   

                   

What are they going to do to me, Sarge?

What are they going to do?



   

                   

Sorry, son, that's not my department.



   

                   

Search him.



   

                   

Where's a camcorder when you need one?



   

                   

It's going to be a long night.

My wife'll kill me.



   

                   

- What is it?

- Cops got lpkiss at Landfill Park.



   

                   

Let me cover it. I need this story.

You go home to Claire.



   

                   

I don't know. Ramsey said--



   

                   

I will take care of Ramsey.



   

                   

Thanks a million, I owe you one.



   

                   

Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...



   

                   

Bike horn...



   

                   

Small-mouthed bass...

bowling pin...



   

                   

mouse-trap...



   

                   

rubber chicken...



   

                   

- Little to the left. That's it.

- I don't know.



   

                   

Funny eyeball glasses...



   

                   

I've never seen those in my life.



   

                   

- bazooka.

- I have a permit for that.



   

                   

- Picture of Kellaway's wife...

- What?



   

                   

CALL ME LOVER!



   

                   

Margaret! Son of a bitch!



   

                   

I figured you had a sense of humor.



   

                   

you married her!



   

                   

That's got to hurt.



   

                   

Get him!



   

                   

It's over. Raise your hands...



   

                   

or we'll fire.



   

                   

Hit it!



   

                   

They call me Cuban Pete

I'm the king of the rumba beat



   

                   

When I play the maracas



   

                   

I go chick-chicky boom



   

                   

Yes, I'm Cuban Pete



   

                   

I'm the craze of my street



   

                   

When I start to dance everything goes

Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom



   

                   

The senoritas sing...



   

                   

and they swing



   

                   

It's very nice



   

                   

Full of spice



   

                   

They dance and bring a happy ring

Never a care



   

                   

Singing a song

All the day long



   

                   

If you like the beat

Take a lesson from Cuban Pete



   

                   

I'll teach you to

chick-chicky boom



   

                   

He's a modest guy



   

                   

Although he's the hottest guy



   

                   

In Havana



   

                   

Si, senorita, I know...



   

                   

that when I chicky boom



   

                   

It's very nice

so full of spice



   

                   

I place my hand on your hip



   

                   

And if you will give me your hand



   

                   

Then we shall try

Just you and I



   

                   

- Not bad.

- Shut up and help me down.



   

                   

I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom

Chick-chicky boom



   

                   

Dance and I'll blow your brains out.



   

                   

Give me that thing.



   

                   

See you!



   

                   

There! Let's get him.

Snap out of it. This dance is over!



   

                   

Let's go! Follow me, officers!



   

                   

He's down the alley. Follow me.

Come on. Grab your gun.



   

                   

Stanley, get in!



   

                   

There!



   

                   

Halt, or I'll shoot!



   

                   

Shoot! Shoot!



   

                   

Seat belts.



   

                   

I missed him.



   

                   

Come on, we all missed him.



   

                   

THE MASK ROBS BANK



   

                   

I saw it.



   

                   

I saw everything.



   

                   

What's happening to you, Stanley?



   

                   

It's crazy.



   

                   

I'm losing control.



   

                   

When I put that mask on...



   

                   

I can do anything.



   

                   

Be anything.



   

                   

It's wrecking my life.



   

                   

My life is wrecked. Wrecked.



   

                   

I don't know what's happening to you...



   

                   

but I do know this:



   

                   

that letter you sent my column...



   

                   

that was from a guy with more guts...



   

                   

and more heart...



   

                   

than any of the creeps

I've met in this city.



   

                   

Whatever that mask is...



   

                   

you don't need it.



   

                   

You...



   

                   

Stanley lpkiss...



   

                   

are already all you'll ever need to be.



   

                   

Gosh, Peg...



   

                   

do you really mean that?



   

                   

Actually...



   

                   

no.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Where were you? I've been vamping

for    minutes.



   

                   

Is this him?



   

                   

You got the    thou'?



   

                   

Give her the money.



   

                   

Right.



   

                   

With the mask on, he turns

into that green thing.



   

                   

What are you doing?



   

                   

Sorry. You really are a great guy,

I just can't lose my condo.



   

                   

It's so hard to find an apartment

in this city.



   

                   

You said you wouldn't hurt him!



   

                   

I lied.



   

                   

Tell me.



   

                   

How's this mask work?



   

                   

I don't know. You just...



   

                   

put it on.



   

                   

Boss...



   

                   

be careful, huh?



   

                   

What a rush.



   

                   

You okay?



   

                   

I'm better than ever, you idiot.



   

                   

What do we do with lpkiss?



   

                   

The police want the mask.



   

                   

We'll give them The Mask.



   

                   

The money better be here...



   

                   

or you can lp-kiss your ass good-bye.



   

                   

Get over there.



   

                   

Can't believe it. Hardened cops

dancing in the street...



   

                   

and broadcast on the    o'clock news.



   

                   

- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.

- I'm history.



   

                   

The Captain'll have my badge

for breakfast with a pension on top.



   

                   

It's not all your fault.

Something will turn up.



   

                   

Sure, lpkiss will fall

right into my lap.



   

                   

Get him off of me!



   

                   

Wait!



   

                   

I can explain everything.



   

                   

You can explain everything?

Explain this!



   

                   

Get him up! Let's go!

I got a cell for you, pal.



   

                   

Forget about me, buddy.



   

                   

Find a new place to live.



   

                   

I'll be in here for a long, long time.



   

                   

You, with the face.



   

                   

You got a visitor.



   

                   

- Why?

- Is it true?



   

                   

You're The Mask.



   

                   

Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

If I get...



   

                   

a good lawyer and a deal...



   

                   

I'll be out in about       years.



   

                   

It's risky, coming here.



   

                   

Your boyfriend might be upset.



   

                   

He'll be at the charity ball tonight.



   

                   

Like what? The Lambada?



   

                   

This is serious. There must be a way

to stop him.



   

                   

How does it work?



   

                   

I don't know.



   

                   

It's like...



   

                   

it brings your innermost desires

to life.



   

                   

If deep down inside...



   

                   

you're a bit repressed and

hopelessly romantic...



   

                   

you become some sort of...



   

                   

a love-crazy wild man.



   

                   

And if you're like Dorian?



   

                   

Then we're all in big trouble.



   

                   

And if I were you,

I'd get out of town. Fast.



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

For what?



   

                   

Lots of things.



   

                   

Sharing a sunset with me.



   

                   

For being the only guy who treated me

like a person, not...



   

                   

a party favor.



   

                   

For being any kind of romantic...



   

                   

even a hopeless one.



   

                   

You're welcome.



   

                   

That night at the club I knew...



   

                   

I'd found someone special.



   

                   

The Mask.



   

                   

It was the guy inside The Mask.



   

                   

It was you all along.



   

                   

Lady, time's up.



   

                   

Could I have just...



   

                   

one more minute?



   

                   

I've got to disappear for a while now.



   

                   

Don't know where but I'll let you know

as soon as I can.



   

                   

Somebody help me!



   

                   

Guard, guard!



   

                   

A woman's being chased in the alley.



   

                   

She needs help.



   

                   

Sure. Keep it down.



   

                   

Serve and protect, man!



   

                   

Good boy. Come on.



   

                   

Jump up. Can you jump up?



   

                   

Remember how I taught you not to

jump up on people? Forget that.



   

                   

Come on! Get up here.



   

                   

Get up. Get up here!



   

                   

Get up. Get up here. That's it.



   

                   

You can do it.

Come on. Come on!



   

                   

Put some effort into it!



   

                   

Baby, there you are.



   

                   

I was worried about you.



   

                   

- You talk to the cops?

- Only to see what lpkiss told them.



   

                   

That's right, you and Stanley.

You two are getting awfully close.



   

                   

Bet you helped him with the bank job.



   

                   

- That's ridiculous.

- Oh, is it?



   

                   

Look what I found in her car.



   

                   

Going away alone, baby?



   

                   

Boys, I want you to...



   

                   

get her something pretty to wear.



   

                   

We're going to a party tonight.



   

                   

We'll have one hell of a time, right?



   

                   

Get out of my sight.



   

                   

Jump up.



   

                   

Get up. Come on.



   

                   

Come on, Milo. Jump, please.



   

                   

Do it for Daddy.



   

                   

That's it!



   

                   

God, I can't believe it.



   

                   

Good boy. Good boy.



   

                   

See that man over there?



   

                   

He's got keys.



   

                   

Go get those keys.



   

                   

Go get them. Go get the keys.



   

                   

That's it.



   

                   

The key.



   

                   

No, not the cheese, the keys.



   

                   

Drop the cheese...



   

                   

and get the keys.



   

                   

Over there, over there.



   

                   

Oh, man. Come on.



   

                   

Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.



   

                   

Give it, give me the keys.

Give me the keys.



   

                   

Come on, drop it, drop it.



   

                   

It's sundown.



   

                   

It's almost time.



   

                   

I wouldn't, darling.



   

                   

DANGER

EXPLOSIVES



   

                   

Wouldn't want to start the

celebration early.



   

                   

Hold it!



   

                   

I am warning you...



   

                   

I am seriously stressed out here.



   

                   

Easy.



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

Don't be an idiot.



   

                   

You're in a police station. There is no

way you'll walk out of here like this.



   

                   

You're know, you're right.



   

                   

- Absolutely right.

- What are you doing?



   

                   

You'll take me out...



   

                   

as your prisoner.



   

                   

Put it on! Put it on!



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

- I'm really very sorry about this.

- I'm sure.



   

                   

You got the wrong guy.



   

                   

It's a bum rap.



   

                   

I got my rights.



   

                   

Where are you taking lpkiss?



   

                   

Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.



   

                   

I get it. Pig Latin, right?



   

                   

Eesay ouyay aterlay.



   

                   

Come on!



   

                   

Sit back and relax.



   

                   

I must change for the party.



   

                   

TONIGHT, CASINO



   

                   

WAR ORPHANS FUND



   

                   

I need cigarettes.



   

                   

- Which brand?

- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.



   

                   

But for you, I would shoot

the Surgeon General.



   

                   

Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?



   

                   

I always have time for the press

and my loyal constituents.



   

                   

Let me out of these cuffs,

you drive like a maniac.



   

                   

Sorry, we're late for the ball.



   

                   

Alice and the rabbit'll be

disappointed.



   

                   

Now you're being cynical.



   

                   

Who are you?



   

                   

I'm just an ex-employee...



   

                   

who's come for his back pay.



   

                   

Or should I say payback?



   

                   

Kill him.



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

Ladies and gentlemen...



   

                   

I will be the host...



   

                   

for the rest of the evening.



   

                   

Get your dog away from me.



   

                   

Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.



   

                   

Where's everyone?

Something's not kosher.



   

                   

- Exactly.

- Watch it!



   

                   

Sorry.



   

                   

I must lock you in.



   

                   

Use the radio.



   

                   

You know, call for back-up

or something.



   

                   

This could be dangerous.

Stay here and be a good boy.



   

                   

Daddy has to go kick some ass.



   

                   

He's a dead man.



   

                   

Down! Get down!



   

                   

Take it easy, I got the point.



   

                   

Blow it!



   

                   

Bastard.



   

                   

What's the matter, darling?



   

                   

This is your big production number.



   

                   

And you know it's important...



   

                   

to go out with a big bang.



   

                   

Why are you here?



   

                   

Take this gun and start

sneaking people out the back.



   

                   

Step back.



   

                   

- Do you know who I am?

- A dead man if you don't step back.



   

                   

What about some respect?



   

                   

- What kind of thug are you?

- All set, Dorian.



   

                   

That's it.



   

                   

This party's over...



   

                   

in    minutes.



   

                   

This is the moment when a man...



   

                   

shows what he's really made of.



   

                   

Crap.



   

                   

Drop it.



   

                   

Smart dog.



   

                   

Boss, look who decided to crash

the party.



   

                   

How's it going?



   

                   

Bring him up here!



   

                   

Wait! No!



   

                   

This is no time for last requests.



   

                   

But all I wanted was a kiss.



   

                   

A kiss?



   

                   

Just one...



   

                   

Iast kiss.



   

                   

I can't shut it off.



   

                   

There's always time...



   

                   

for one last kiss.



   

                   

From the real Dorian.



   

                   

The one I used to love.



   

                   

Nobody ever kissed me

like Dorian Tyrel.



   

                   

Romeo!



   

                   

This place will blow!



   

                   

Just wait!



   

                   

I've decided...



   

                   

to give her one last thrill.



   

                   

Get it!



   

                   

Run, Milo!



   

                   

Stanley, hurry!



   

                   

Don't worry.



   

                   

It's all over now.



   

                   

Got you.



   

                   

I'll take you apart.



   

                   

I hope you can enjoy the victory

with one freaking eye!



   

                   

Good doggie.



   

                   

Good doggie.



   

                   

I'm winning!



   

                   

JACKPOT



   

                   

Oh, my God!



   

                   

This must be a new breed.



   

                   

Easy, boy!



   

                   

Good boy!



   

                   

Did you miss me?



   

                   

I guess not!



   

                   

Now, you have to ask yourself

one question:



   

                   

"Do I feel lucky?"



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

do you...



   

                   

punks?



   

                   

That's a spicy meatball.



   

                   

How do?



   

                   

This guy's incorrigible.



   

                   

You were good, kid, real good...



   

                   

but as long as I'm around

you'll be second-best.



   

                   

Police! Hands up!



   

                   

Officers, arrest those men.



   

                   

I've always wanted to say that.



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

Give me that gun.



   

                   

He stole all our jewelry.

Take me to headquarters...



   

                   

Stop that man!



   

                   

I've got you now.



   

                   

Watch it, Chunky!



   

                   

- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--

- What's wrong with you?



   

                   

That man is The Mask.       

No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.

I saw it with my own eyes.



   

                   

This man here saved our lives.



   

                   

- With a little help.

- You're a real hero.



   

                   

It's nothing...



   

                   

any American with...



   

                   

balls of steel wouldn't do

for his community.



   

                   

Come on.



   

                   

Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?



   

                   

Leave the dog alone.



   

                   

I want you in my office

first thing tomorrow.



   

                   

- Yes, Your Honor.

- That doesn't sound good at all.



   

                   

No, it doesn't.

What would sound good to you?



   

                   

- Breakfast.

- Shut up!



   

                   

Sure you know what you're doing?



   

                   

I'm sure.



   

                   

Then do what you must.



   

                   

Sure you won't miss this guy?



   

                   

When he's gone, all that's left is me.



   

                   

Smoking!
